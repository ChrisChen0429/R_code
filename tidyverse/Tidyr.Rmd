## Tidy Data & Relational Data
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```


### tibble
```{r}
iris <- as_tibble(iris)


tibble(
  `:)` = "smile", 
  ` ` = "space",
  `2000` = "number"
)


tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  #--|--|----
  "a", 2, 3.6,
  "b", 1, 8.5
)

df <- tibble(
  x = runif(5),
  y = rnorm(5)
)

df %>% .$x
df %>% .[["x"]]
df %>% .[[1]]
```



### tidy data

#### longer
```{r}
table4a
(table4a %>%
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases",values_drop_na = TRUE))

```

#### wider
```{r}
table2
(table2 %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count))
```

#### separate 
```{r}
table3
table3 %>% separate(rate,into = c("case","population"),sep = "/",convert = TRUE) ## convert into better format

table3 %>% 
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = 2) ## select two digit

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>%
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), extra = "drop")

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>%
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), extra = "merge")

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>%
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), fill = "left")


#The function extract() uses a regular expression to specify groups in character vector and split that single character vector into multiple columns. This is more flexible than separate() because it does not require a common separator or specific column positions.
tibble(x = c("X1", "X2", "Y1", "Y2")) %>%
  extract(x, c("variable", "id"), regex = "([A-Z])([0-9])")
```

#### Unite
```{r}
table5
table5 %>% unite(date, century, year, sep = "")

```

#### missing
```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016),
  qtr    = c(   1,    2,    3,    4,    2,    3,    4),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.35,   NA, 0.92, 0.17, 2.66)
)
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, qtr) ## find the explicit and implicit missing.


(treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,           ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,           7,
  NA,                 2,           10,
  NA,                 3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",  1,           4
))

# fill() takes a set of columns where you want missing values to be replaced by the most recent non-missing value (sometimes called last observation carried forward).
treatment %>% 
  fill(person)
```

### relational data

![database structure](structure.png)


#### mutate join
```{r}
flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)

flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>% 
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  top_n(5)


## same as
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>% 
  mutate(name = airlines$name[match(carrier, airlines$carrier)]) %>%
  top_n(5)

# The default, by = NULL, uses all variables that appear in both tables, the so called natural join.
flights2 %>% 
  left_join(weather)%>%
  top_n(5)

#  A named character vector: by = c("a" = "b"). This will match variable a in table x to variable b in table y.
flights2 %>% 
  left_join(airports, c("dest" = "faa"))
```


#### filter join

* semi_join(x, y) keeps all observations in x that have a match in y.

* anti_join(x, y) drops all observations in x that have a match in y.

```{r}
top_dest <- flights %>%
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(10)

flights %>% 
  filter(dest %in% top_dest$dest)%>%
  head(10)

flights %>% 
  semi_join(top_dest)%>%
  head(10)

flights %>%
  anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)%>%
  head(10)
```


#### exercise
```{r}
#Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. 
flights %>% group_by(dest) %>% summarise(average_delay = mean(arr_delay,na.rm=TRUE)) %>% inner_join(airports,by=c('dest'='faa')) %>% top_n(5)

#Add the location of the origin and destination (i.e. the lat and lon) to flights.
airport_location <- airports %>% select(faa,lat,lon)

  left_join(airport_location,by=c('origin'='faa')) %>%

#Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?

#What happened on June 13 2013? Display the spatial pattern of delays, and then use Google to cross-reference with the weather.
flights %>% filter(year==2013,month==6,day==13) %>%
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay,na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  inner_join(airports,by=c('dest'='faa')) 



# What does it mean for a flight to have a missing tailnum? What do the tail numbers that donâ€™t have a matching record in planes have in common? (Hint: one variable explains ~90% of the problems.)
flights %>% anti_join(planes,by="tailnum") %>%
  count(carrier,sort = T) %>%
  mutate(percenage = n/sum(n))

## most are MQ or AA



#Filter flights to only show flights with planes that have flown at least 100 flights.
flights %>% semi_join(
  flights %>% filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%
  count(tailnum) %>% filter(n>100),
  by='tailnum')


#Find the 48 hours (over the course of the whole year) that have the worst delays. Cross-reference it with the weather data. Can you see any patterns?
worst_hours <- flights %>%

  group_by(origin, year, month, day, hour) %>%

```



#### set operation

* intersect(x, y): return only observations in both x and y.

* union(x, y): return unique observations in x and y.

* setdiff(x, y): return observations in x, but not in y.
